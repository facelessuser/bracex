Brace expanding is used to generate arbitrary strings. $ echo {{ a,b } ,c } d ad bd cd Bracex adds this ability to Python: >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file-{1,2,3}.txt' ) ['file-1.txt', 'file-2.txt', 'file-3.txt'] Why Bracex over other solutions? Bracex actually follows pretty closely to how Bash processes braces. It is not a 1:1 implementation of how Bash handles braces, but generally, it follows very closely. Almost all of the test cases are run through Bash first, then our implementation is compared against the results Bash gives. There are a few cases where we have purposely deviated. For instance, we are not handling Bash's command line inputs, so we are not giving special meaning to back ticks and quotes at this time. More Examples: >>> bracex . expand ( r '-v{,,}' ) ['-v', '-v', '-v'] Nested braces: >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file-{{a,b},c}d.txt' ) ['file-ad.txt', 'file-bd.txt', 'file-cd.txt'] Numerical sequences: >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file{0..3}.txt' ) ['file0.txt', 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt'] >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file{0..6..2}.txt' ) ['file0.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file4.txt', 'file6.txt'] >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file{00..10..5}.jpg' ) ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg'] Alphabetic sequences: >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file{A..D}.txt' ) ['fileA.txt', 'fileB.txt', 'fileC.txt', 'fileD.txt'] >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file{A..G..2}.txt' ) ['fileA.txt', 'fileC.txt', 'fileE.txt', 'fileG.txt'] Allows escaping: >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file\\{00..10..5}.jpg' ) ['file{00..10..5}.jpg'] >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file\\{00..10..5}.jpg' , keep_escapes = True ) ['file\\\\{00..10..5}.jpg'] Bracex will not expand braces in the form of ${...} : >>> bracex . expand ( r 'file${a,b,c}.jpg' ) ['file${a,b,c}.jpg'] Install $ pip install bracex API expand() def expand ( string , keep_escapes = False , limit = 1000 ): expand accepts a string and returns a list of expanded strings. It will always return at least a single empty string [\"\"] . By default, escapes will be resolved and the backslashes reduced accordingly, but keep_escapes will process the escapes without stripping them out. By default, brace expansion growth is limited to 1000 . This limit can be configured via the limit option. If you would like to remove the limit option, you simply set limit to 0 . iexpand() def iexpand ( string , keep_escapes = False , limit = 1000 ): iexpand is just like expand except it returns a generator.","title":"Bracex"},{"location":"#bracex","text":"","title":"Bracex"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Bracex is a brace expanding library (\u00e0 la Bash) for Python.

Coding Standards When writing code, the code should roughly conform to PEP8 and PEP257 suggestions. The project utilizes the Flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules). When in doubt, follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding files or modifying existing files. Listed below are the modules used: pycqa/flake8 pycqa/flake8-docstrings pycqa/pep8-naming ebeweber/flake8-mutable gforcada/flake8-builtins Usually this can be automated with Tox (assuming it is installed): tox -e lint . Building and Editing Documents Documents are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax provided by extensions) and are converted to HTML via Python Markdown. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed: Python-Markdown/markdown : the Markdown parser. mkdocs/mkdocs : the document site generator. squidfunk/mkdocs-material : a material theme for MkDocs. facelessuser/pymdown-extensions : this Python Markdown extension bundle. In order to build and preview the documents, just run the command below from the root of the project and you should be able to view the documents at localhost:8000 in your browser. After that, you should be able to update the documents and have your browser preview update live. mkdocs serve Spell Checking Documents Spell checking is performed via facelessuser/pyspelling . During validation we build the docs and spell check various files in the project. Aspell must be installed and in the path. Currently this project uses one of the more recent versions of Aspell. It is not expected that everyone will install and run Aspell locally, but it will be run in CI tests for pull requests. In order to perform the spell check locally, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in your system path (if needed you can use the --binary option to point to the location of your Aspell binary). It is also expected that you have the en dictionary installed as well. To initiate the spell check, run the following command from the root of the project. You will need to make sure the documents are built first: mkdocs build --clean And then run the spell checker. pyspelling It should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found. If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in docs/src/dictionary/en-custom.text . Validation Tests In order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with pytest ( pytest-dev/pytest ). To run these tests, you can use the following command: py.test Running Validation With Tox Tox ( tox-dev/tox ) is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell). You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same. First, you need to have Tox installed: pip install tox By running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests. See tox.ini to learn more. tox If you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail. To run the tests for specific versions of Python, you specify the environment with -e PXY where X is the major version and Y is the minor version. tox -e py37 To target linting: tox -e lint To select spell checking and document building: tox -e documents Code Coverage When running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the Coverage ( ned/coveragepy ) module. Coverage is run on each pyxx environment. If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data: coverage erase Then run each unit test environment to generate coverage data. All the data from each run is merged together. HTML is output for each file in .tox/pyXX/tmp . You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing.
